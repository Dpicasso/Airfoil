# Airfoil
2-D analysis on Airfoil using FLUENT
#Summary

  This project will be ananlyzing a two dimensional profile of an airfoil using Ansys design modeler and Fluent solver. A velocity will be associated with the airfoil simulating flight and angle of attack will be varied to measure the change in pressure coefficients. The values will then be processed using linear regression and predictions can be made with the gathered data for a value of lift coefficient with specific angles of attack
